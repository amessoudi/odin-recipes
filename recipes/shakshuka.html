    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shakshuka is a dish of eggs poached in a spiced tomato sauce, likely originated in North Africa, specifically in the Maghreb region, which includes modern-day Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria. The name "shakshuka" is thought to be derived from the Amazigh (Berber) language, meaning "all mixed up". While its exact origins are debated, it's widely accepted that the dish's development was influenced by the arrival of tomatoes and peppers from the Americas</p>
